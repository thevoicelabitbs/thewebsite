I'm creating a BOLD, CREATIVE landing page for "The Voice Lab" - ITBS students practicing English with international peers.

LEARN MY BRAND STYLE from these Instagram posts I'm providing (Images 1 & 2):
- Notice the BOLD typography mixing white and colored words
- See the vibrant blue-to-purple gradients
- Observe how text has IMPACT with size variation
- Color palette: Blues, purples, coral/orange accents
- Modern, youthful, energetic but professional

RECREATE THIS AESTHETIC for the website.

======================

- Letter-spacing: Tight (-0.03em to -0.05em)
- Body: Font weight 600 minimum, text-xl
- Text shadows for depth
- Fallback: System fonts

COLORS (Match Instagram style):
- Deep blues (#2563eb, #1e40af)
- Purple gradients (#7c3aed, #9333ea)

- White text as primary

REFERENCE: Image 1 shows blue-to-teal gradient. Image 2 shows purple-to-blue gradient with white + orange text mixing.

CRITICAL CORRECTIONS
======================

✓ Headline: "Grow Your Professional International Network" (check grammar)

✓ "TALK" in orange when emphasizing
✓ "FOR FREE" in orange at end of gap section
✓ "Three countries" not "four countries"
✓ Sunday prep is ONE-TIME ONLY, not weekly - make it urgent
✓ Step 2: Introduce yourself to build community (not for matching)
✓ Banner: "LAST CHANCE! Entry prep session starts in..."
✓ All CTAs link to: https://chat.whatsapp.com/G5ncFqtqtmT5gSBewjD93m
✓ "ITBS students" not "Tunisian students"
✓ Emphasize introducing yourself is REQUIRED
